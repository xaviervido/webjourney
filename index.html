        <h2>The Beginning of the Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            I never imagined that learning how to create web pages would be so challenging. 
            At first, staring at lines of code felt like deciphering an alien language. 
            I struggled with understanding even the most basic tags. The thought of styling with CSS felt like an impossible feat.

        <p>
            Days turned into weeks as I poured over tutorials and articles. The frustration was real, and there were moments when 
            I wanted to give up. But then I discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>, 
            which became a guiding light in my journey.
        </p>

        <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
            With structured lessons and hands-on projects, freeCodeCamp taught me the basics step by step. 
            I began to understand HTML and CSS not just as tools but as creative outlets. Each new concept felt 
            like unlocking a new superpower. I learned to turn frustration into curiosity, and the once-daunting syntax 
            became second nature.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned in HTML</h3>
        <p>Here are five key topics I mastered during my HTML learning journey:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Structuring content with semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Creating links and navigation menus with <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags.</li>
            <li>Embedding images and multimedia using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags.</li>
            <li>Organizing information with tables and lists.</li>
            <li>Forms for user input with <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Support System</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout this journey, I was fortunate to have the support of friends who cheered me on. 
            Hereâ€™s a shout-out to those who made this experience bearable:
        </p>

        <h2>The Sweet Taste of Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, the day came when I could build my own web page from scratch. 
            The feeling was exhilarating. What once seemed like an impossible mountain to climb 
            became a journey of growth and achievement. Today, I can confidently say I love creating with HTML and CSS.
